### 👋 Hi, I’m @azametileb

- 👀 I’m interested in graphic design, front-end development & back-end-development, and creating visually stunning web applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript from The Odin Project, coupled with various graphic design tools through YouTube tutorials and Pinterest inspirations.
- 🌱 The goal is to first equip myself with the requisite tools and thenchoose between a Full Stack JavaScript and Full Stack Rails path, both designed to further develop the foundation established in this course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn and collaborate in interesting projects that for the common good of helping each individual a better programmer.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via [email](azameticaleb3@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/caleb-azameti).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact:  Though, setting a **rigid schedule** is against the taching policy of **The Odin Project**, I have set on 100-day journey (I consider a healthy challenge) dedicating 5 hours with steady breaks daily to mastering front-end, back-end development and graphic design!
